          <tr>
            <td>What is an ergonomic keyboard?</td>
            <td>A keyboard designed to reduce strain and improve comfort while typing. There are different improvements, such as split, tenting, cushioning, and ortholinear layouts.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Why do I use an ergonomic keyboard?</td>
            <td>I had a weird typing habit that made me press the space key with my index finger instead of my thumb. This over time caused discomfort and strain, leading me to seek a chance to relearn my typing technique. A ergonomic keyboard helps me with this process.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>What is my daily driver?</td>
            <td>My daily driver is a ZSA Moonlander MK1, which features a split, tenting, and ortholinear design with thumb clusters.

            <td>What is my favorite keyboard layout?</td>
            <td>I use Colemak DH as my daily driver, and only switch to QWERTY when gaming. This is because the most commonly used letters in English are all concentrated in the home row.

          <tr>
            <td>Why are split keyboards popular?</td>
            <td>They allow for a more natural hand position, reducing wrist strain.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>What is tenting?</td>
            <td>Tenting refers to raising the middle of the keyboard, which helps keep wrists in a more neutral position.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>What is an ortholinear layout?</td>
            <td>An ortholinear layout arranges keys in a grid pattern, which can minimize wrist movement and increase typing efficiency.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Why are some ergonomic keyboards curved?</td>
            <td>Curved keyboards are designed to match the natural shape of the hands, promoting a more comfortable typing posture.</td>
