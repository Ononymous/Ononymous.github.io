            <td>What is Japan for me?</td>
            <td>Japan is a magical place that holds a special significance for me. As a Japanese person who lived in China, I used to visit Japan every summer during my break. These trips allowed me to experience the beautiful and fun aspects of the country. Additionally, I once traveled to Japan alone for a month, which was a transformative experience that helped me find myself.</td>

            <td>What are some myths about Japan?</td>
            <td>Japanese people are nice, but also very reserved. Usually if you don't strike up a conversation yourself, they will be either indifferent or polite.</td>

            <td>Why is Japan my most recommended solo-travel destination?</td>
            <td>Japan is very safe, clean, and has literally endless places to explore. On their way, people will also feel the right amount of loneliness from the remote environment, which is, in my opinion, a perfect place for them to know more about themselves rather than others.</td>

            <td>What is my recommended hidden gem stone in Japan?</td>
            <td>There are tons of hidden and remote places that travelers will remember for the rest of their lives, but the one for me is Rokko mountain in Kobe, Hyogo prefecture. When I solo traveled there, there was only one hostel there, no public transportation except a gondola lift that carries people on and off the mountain. It is developed enough for you to be able to walk on paved roads, but still feels remote and untouched.

            <td>What is my recommendation for anybody who wants to go to Japan?</td>
            <td>With the current state of tourism in Japan, I would suggest planning a trip to a not-so-popular prefecture would be the best option. Personally, I prefer to explore the lesser-known areas, as they often offer a more authentic experience of Japanese culture and lifestyle.</td>

            <td>Spring, because cherry blossoms are in full bloom around late March to early April, and the temperature is the best around then.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>What is my favorite Japanese city?</td>
            <td>Kyoto. It is a city that perfectly blends traditional and modern elements, with its stunning temples, beautiful gardens, and vibrant culture. I would always recommend people to book an Airbnb next to a popular shrine (such as Fushimi Inari Taisha), and visit them at night to avoid the tourism rush.

            <td>What is my favorite Japanese tradition?</td>
            <td>Kimodameshi (a test of courage) is a traditional activity in which participants spend a night in a haunted location. It is often done in groups and involves various challenges to confront fears. It definitely feels different when there are so many stories about yurei (ghosts) and yokai (supernatural creatures).</td>

            <td>What is my favorite anime?</td>
